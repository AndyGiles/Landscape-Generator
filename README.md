# Landscape-Generator
Code using the Python turtle library that randomly draws a landscape, with sky, mountains, and trees.

To use, run landscape.py, and enter a number when the terminal window pops up. This number will represent the degree of detail to which the landscape is drawn. Every additional increment of this number will increase the detail, and therefore the total time to run, by a factor of 2. A recommended number to enter for a good balance of time and detail is 8.
